Changed: The TimerOutput class now includes run time spent in currently active
subsections in its reports. Previously it would only report time spent in
sections that had already been left. Additionally, CPU time spent in sections
is now reported as the sum over all processes in the given MPI communicator.
Previously, it would only report for each section the CPU time on the current
process. This meant the time spent in sections would not add up to the total
CPU time, which was always reported as the sum over all MPI processes.
